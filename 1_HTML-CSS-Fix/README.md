# Web Development Projects

Welcome ðŸ‘‹  

This folder contains a collection of my work in web development.  
Here youâ€™ll find different projects that demonstrate how websites can be built, structured, and improved over time.  

The projects are organized into versions, showing both the original drafts and the corrected versions. This makes it easier to see the progress made and how issues were identified and resolved.  

Feel free to explore each project to view the layouts, features, and improvements.
