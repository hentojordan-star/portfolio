# Starfield Academy – School Portal Project

This project is a web-based portal designed for **Starfield Academy**.  
It includes two versions of the site: an initial draft with several issues and a corrected version that addresses those problems.

## ⚠️ Before Version
The **before** version was the first draft of the portal and contains:
- Hardcoded news, scores, and event data directly in HTML.  
- Inline styling and a bulky layout that is not responsive.  
- Tables and sections that are not well-structured or aligned.  
- Limited interactivity and poor code organization.

## ✅ After Version
The **after** version improves the portal with:
- News, scores, and events loaded dynamically from JSON files.  
- Separate folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Data for better organization.  
- Responsive and clean design using modern CSS.  
- Semantic HTML tags and improved table structures for clarity.  
- Smooth interactions and better maintainability.
