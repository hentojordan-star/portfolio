# Python Projects

This folder contains a collection of Python-based programs that Iâ€™ve worked on.  
Each project is built around real use cases and practical needs, with an emphasis on writing clear and maintainable code.

---

## Overview

The projects here cover different areas of programming, such as data handling, process automation, and small utilities that could be useful in everyday tasks or for small businesses.  

Some of them include an initial draft of the code and an improved version that addresses errors, reorganizes the logic, or adds missing features.

## Key Points

- Projects are inspired by real-world scenarios.  
- Some include both draft and revised versions to show how the code was improved.  
- JSON files are used in certain cases to store data for easy access and persistence.  
- File structures are kept simple and easy to follow.

## How to Run

1. Open a project folder.  
2. Check the `README.md` inside for details on that project.  
3. Run the Python file with:  

```bash
python filename.py
```
Note

This folder will continue to grow with more Python projects over time. Each one is intended to be practical, functional, and easy to adapt to different needs.
